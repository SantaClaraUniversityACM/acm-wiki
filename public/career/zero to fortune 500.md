# Zero to Fortune 500 and Beyond

Written by Jake Esperson, 2025.

Hello! My name is Jake Esperson and, along with being the current president of ACM, I am also a software engineer at Western Digital, currently number 334 on the Fortune 500 list. That's pretty cool, but I feel like, without the help of my extremely talented and dedicated peers, I would not be where I am today. Although it is certainly not the peak of my and possibly your career, I want to create a guide for those that may have no idea where to start or how to get there. This guide will be a collection of tips, technologies, and career building necessities that I have learned along the way. I hope that this guide will help you in your journey to becoming a software engineer and achieving your career goals, whether you're starting from zero or just looking for more guidance!

## How I got here

TLDR: I sucked, learned a lot in hackathons and workshops, got an internship at CMG Financial via personal connection, and got really lucky to land a job at Western Digital.

I started at SCU with basic knowledge from APCSA, but I was not ready for the real CS world. My first hackathon, INRIX Hack 2022, was a disaster. I had no idea what I was doing and my team fell apart in a couple of hours. However, I was determined to learn and improve. I started paying more attention to ACM workshops and doing my own research, which led to me being more prepared for Hack for Humanity 2023. I still sucked, APIs were a concept I just couldn't wrap my head around. Although my team finished the hackathon, I was still not happy with my performance. Over that summer, I went to work learning more about React and Flask, as well as practice Leetcode. My hard work paid off when I started fully finishing my hackathon projects, including a win at AWS x INRIX Hack Seattle 2023.

I then got an internship at CMG Financial through a personal connection. Unfortunately, not a high profile company or even a SWE job at all, but I used the flexibility of a non-tech company to show my manager what I was capable of and eventually got pushed to the DevOps team. After becoming VP of ACM and taking on a more mentorship role in hackathons, I learned a lot about a bunch of different technologies and how to fix them on the fly for teams. Eventually, I got lucky and landed a job at Western Digital. I didn't even apply for the role I wanted, but I was flagged for my DevOps experience and eventually got an offer for a DevOps role.

Everyone's journey is different, but some takeaways I have for anyone are that

- A lot of internship opportunities, especially in this job market, are luck-based without connections. However, by having more experience via projects and hackathons, you can manufacture luck.
- Hackathons should be a must-attend event for getting experience on your resume.
- Don't be afraid to ask for help. Everyone is willing to help you, especially in ACM.
